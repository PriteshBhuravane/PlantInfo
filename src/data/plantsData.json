    "description": "Butea monosperma, popularly called 'Palas' or 'Flame of the Forest', is a medium-sized deciduous tree admired for its spectacular flowering display. During late winter to early spring (February to April), when most trees shed their leaves, Palas bursts into bloom with dense clusters of vibrant orange to scarlet pea-shaped flowers that cover the entire canopy, giving the appearance of a tree engulfed in flames. The flowers attract bees, birds, and squirrels, making it an important ecological species. The trifoliate leaves are large, leathery, and shed annually before flowering, allowing the blossoms to stand out vividly against a bare backdrop. Its rough gray bark exudes a reddish gum known as 'Bengal Kino' or 'Palas gum', which has significant medicinal and commercial uses. After flowering, the tree produces flat, thin, papery pods containing a single seed. Because of its ability to thrive in dry, poor soils, Palas is often found in tropical and subtropical dry forests, open grasslands, and village landscapes across India. Beyond its striking beauty, it holds cultural, religious, and medicinal significance, being associated with rituals, Ayurvedic medicine, and the Holi festival where its flowers are used to make natural eco-friendly colors.",

The tree produces small, round figs in pairs that ripen from green to purple, serving as food for birds, bats, and squirrels. Ecologically, it is considered a 'keystone species' that sustains biodiversity by providing shade, shelter, and nutrition. Culturally, the Pimpal is sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment under a Peepal tree, hence it is often called the 'Bodhi Tree'.

    "description": "Schleichera oleosa, commonly known as Kusum, is a large, slow-growing deciduous tree valued for its medicinal, economic, and ecological importance. The tree is easily recognized by its young reddish foliage, which later turns lush green, creating a striking seasonal display. Kusum produces small yellow-green flowers followed by oval fruits containing seeds rich in oil. The seed oil, known as Kusum oil, is traditionally used for cooking, medicinal preparations, and as a base for hair oils and soaps. The tree is also a primary host for lac insects, which produce natural lac used in varnish, jewelry, and traditional crafts. Its dense, strong wood is highly durable and used for furniture, tools, and construction. Culturally, Kusum holds significance in rural economies as a multipurpose tree, providing shade, timber, oil, and income through lac cultivation. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is well-suited for afforestation and agroforestry projects.",
